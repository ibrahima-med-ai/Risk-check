Nutrition and Health:

1. Daily caloric needs depend on several factors: age, sex, weight, height, physical activity level.
2. The Mifflin-St Jeor formula is a recognized method to estimate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
3. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is calculated by multiplying BMR with an activity factor.
4. To lose weight, a caloric deficit of about 500 kcal/day is recommended.
5. To gain weight, a caloric surplus of about 500 kcal/day with strength training is effective.
6. A balanced diet includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats, fibers, vitamins, and minerals.
7. Proper hydration is essential for metabolic function.
8. Regular physical activity improves body composition and cardiovascular health.
9. Extreme or unbalanced diets should be avoided to maintain health.
10. Nutritional needs may vary due to medical conditions, pregnancy, etc.
